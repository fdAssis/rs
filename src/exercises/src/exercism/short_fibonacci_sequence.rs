/**
 * Instructions
 *  You are going to initialize empty buffers and list the first five numbers,
 *  or elements, of the Fibonacci sequence.
 *  
 *  The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers where the next
 *  element is the sum of the prior two. We start the sequence at one.
 *  So the first two elements are 1 and 1.
